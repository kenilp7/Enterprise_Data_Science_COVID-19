# Enterprise Data Science Project 2022

### Applied Data Science Project

Datasets used - John Hopkins Dataset

Libraries used - Numpy, Scikit learn, Pandas, MatplotLib, Plotly

Language used - Python

About the project: An analysis of the corona cases of different countries around the globe, the doubling rate associated and the general trend. Alongwith this, implementation of SIR (Susceptible population, Infectious population and Recovered population) for different countries.

How to use the contents:

1. To run the dynamic dashboard, simply clone then repository -> go to notebooks/05_Evalaution_walk_through.py
2. To run the SIR model for different countries -> go to notebooks/08_SIR_modelling.py
